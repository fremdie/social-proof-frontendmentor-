## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned CSS Grid with this challenge, and worked a little more with Flexbox.


```css
    main {
      display: grid; 
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; 
      grid-template-rows: 1fr; 
      gap: 0px 0px; 
      grid-template-areas: 
        ". ."
        " . "; 
    }
```

### Continued development

I have so much to still learn. I'll continue to put in the work.
